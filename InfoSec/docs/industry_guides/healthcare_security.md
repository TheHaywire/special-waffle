## Key Compliance Requirements
- **HIPAA:** PHI protection, audit controls, access management, incident response
- **HITECH:** Breach notification, security risk assessment, EHR security
- **GDPR:** Data privacy, consent management, breach reporting

## Example: Audit Logging for HIPAA
- Deploy [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) or [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) for immutable audit logs
- Log all access to PHI, configuration changes, and system events
- Regularly review logs for unauthorized access or anomalies

---

## Example: EDR for Endpoint Security
- Deploy [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/) or [Velociraptor](https://www.velocidex.com/)
- Monitor endpoints for malware, ransomware, and suspicious activity
- Set up automated alerts and response actions

---

## Incident Response Workflow (PHI Breach)
1. **Detection:** EDR or SIEM alert for unauthorized PHI access or exfiltration
2. **Triage:** Analyst reviews logs, confirms scope of breach
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems, disable compromised accounts
4. **Eradication:** Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, reset credentials
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems, monitor for recurrence
6. **Reporting:** Notify affected individuals and regulators as required by HIPAA/HITECH/GDPR

---

## Sector-Specific Tips
- Encrypt PHI at rest and in transit
- Regularly test incident response with simulated breach scenarios
- Train staff on phishing, social engineering, and privacy best practices
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for EHR and PHI systems
- Document all compliance activities for audits
