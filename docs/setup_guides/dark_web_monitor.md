# Setup Guide: Open-Source Dark Web Monitoring Tool

---

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy and use an open-source dark web monitoring tool, such as PasteHunter, a custom scraper, or a dark web feed aggregator. These tools help detect leaked credentials, sensitive data, or targeted keywords on paste sites and dark web sources.

---

## Prerequisites
- Linux server, VM, or desktop (Ubuntu recommended)
- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Internet access (for scraping and feed collection)

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Tool
- **PasteHunter**: Open-source paste site scraper ([GitHub](https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter))
- **Custom Scraper**: Build your own with Python (requests, BeautifulSoup)
- **Feed Aggregator**: Use or build a tool to collect and parse dark web feeds

---

## Step 2: Deploy PasteHunter (Example)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter.git
cd PasteHunter
pip install -r requirements.txt
python PasteHunter.py --config config.json
```
- Edit `config.json` to set keywords, output location, and alerting options

---

## Step 3: (Optional) Build a Custom Scraper
- Use Python libraries (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `re`) to scrape paste sites or dark web forums
- Search for keywords, emails, or patterns of interest
- Store results in a database or send alerts via email/Slack

---

## Step 4: Monitor and Alert
- Schedule the tool to run regularly (cron, systemd, or Docker)
- Integrate with SIEM or ticketing systems for alerting
- Review findings and investigate potential leaks

---

## Step 5: Example Usage
- Run PasteHunter with a custom config to monitor for your organization’s domains, emails, or keywords
- Review output files or logs for matches

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure required Python dependencies are installed
- Some paste sites may block scraping—rotate user agents or use proxies
- Respect legal and ethical boundaries when scraping dark web sources
- Regularly update keyword lists and tool dependencies
