# Setup Guide: Open-Source Incident Response Playbook Platform

---

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy an open-source incident response (IR) playbook platform using TheHive, a custom Markdown-based playbook, or an open-source SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tool. The platform will help standardize, automate, and track incident response processes.

---

## Prerequisites
- Linux server or VM (Ubuntu recommended)
- 4+ GB RAM, 2+ CPUs
- Docker (recommended) or root access for manual install
- Python 3.x (for custom scripts)
- Basic knowledge of incident response processes

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Platform
- **TheHive**: Open-source IR platform for case management ([GitHub](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive))
- **Markdown Playbooks**: Store playbooks in version control, render with MkDocs or GitBook
- **Open-Source SOAR**: Tools like Shuffle ([GitHub](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle)) for automation

---

## Step 2: Deploy TheHive (Docker Example)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive-Docker.git
cd TheHive-Docker
sudo docker compose up -d
```
- Access TheHive at http://localhost:9000 (default credentials: admin@thehive.local / secret)

---

## Step 3: Create and Import Playbooks
- In TheHive, create case templates for common incidents (phishing, malware, insider threat, etc.)
- Define tasks, checklists, and response steps for each case type
- For Markdown playbooks, organize by incident type and use MkDocs or GitBook for web access

---

## Step 4: Automate Response (Optional)
- Integrate with open-source SOAR (e.g., Shuffle) for automated actions (e.g., block IP, reset password)
- Use webhooks or scripts to trigger automation from TheHive or playbook steps

---

## Step 5: Track and Report
- Use TheHive dashboard to track case status, metrics, and timelines
- Export reports for compliance and lessons learned

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure required ports (9000, 9200, etc.) are open
- Check Docker/container logs for errors if services do not start
- For Markdown playbooks, verify static site generator config
- Regularly update the platform for security patches
