# Application Security Architectures

## 1. LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Agents

**Description:**
LLM-driven pentesting agents automate web application security testing, payload generation, and vulnerability reporting using large language models.

    A[User/Analyst] -->|Target URL| B[Web UI/API]
    B -->|Scan Request| C[Pentest Orchestrator]
    C -->|Test Plan| D[LLM Engine]
    D -->|Payloads/Analysis| E[Web Scanner]
    E -->|Findings| F[Reporting Engine]
    F -->|Report| A
    E -->|Logs| G[SIEM/Log Management]
```

**Key Components:**
- Web UI/API: User interface for scan configuration and results.
- Pentest Orchestrator: Manages scan workflow and LLM interaction.
- LLM Engine: Generates payloads, analyzes responses, and suggests next steps.
- Web Scanner: Executes tests against the target application.
- Reporting Engine: Aggregates and formats findings.
- SIEM/Log Management: Stores scan logs and events.

## 2. API Security Scanner

**Description:**
An API security scanner tests RESTful or GraphQL APIs for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance with security best practices.

**Architecture Diagram:**

    B -->|Scan Request| C[API Scanner Engine]
    C -->|Fuzzing/Tests| D[Target API]
    D -->|Responses| C
    C -->|Vulnerability Findings| E[Reporting Module]
    E -->|Report| A
    C -->|Logs| F[SIEM/Log Management]
```

**Key Components:**
- API Scanner UI: Interface for specifying API endpoints and scan options.
- API Scanner Engine: Orchestrates tests, fuzzing, and analysis.
- Target API: The API under test.
- Reporting Module: Summarizes and presents findings.
- SIEM/Log Management: Stores scan logs and events.
