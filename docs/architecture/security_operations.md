# Security Operations (SOC/SIEM/IR) Architectures

---

## 1. AI-Powered SOC Dashboard

**Description:**
A modern SOC dashboard integrates real-time threat monitoring, digital forensics, and incident response, enhanced by AI/ML for detection and automation.

    F -->|Evidence| D
    E -->|Remediation| G[IT/Cloud Systems]
    C -->|Logs| H[SIEM/Log Management]
```

**Key Components:**
- Ingestion Pipeline: Collects and normalizes data from multiple sources.
- AI/ML Detection Engine: Identifies threats and anomalies.
- Analyst Dashboard: Central interface for monitoring and response.
- Orchestration/Playbooks: Automates response actions.
- Forensics Module: Supports investigation and evidence collection.
- SIEM/Log Management: Stores and correlates events.

## 2. Incident Response Simulation Tool

**Description:**
A simulation platform for practicing and testing incident response plans, including attack scenarios, decision-making, and communication.

**Architecture Diagram:**

    B -->|Simulated Attacks| C[Participant Team]
    C -->|Response Actions| B
    B -->|Metrics/Logs| D[Reporting & Feedback]
    D -->|Review| A
```

**Key Components:**
- Simulation Engine: Orchestrates attack scenarios and tracks responses.
- Participant Team: Security team members practicing IR.
- Reporting & Feedback: Provides metrics, logs, and after-action reviews.
- Admin/Trainer: Designs scenarios and reviews performance.

## 3. Open Source SIEM

**Description:**
A SIEM system collects, stores, correlates, and analyzes security events from across the organization, enabling detection and compliance.

**Architecture Diagram:**

    A[Log/Event Sources] --> B[Log Collector/Agent]
    B --> C[Ingestion Pipeline]
    C --> D[Correlation & Rules Engine]
    D -->|Alerts| E[Analyst Dashboard]
    D -->|Reports| F[Compliance Module]
    D -->|Storage| G[Data Lake/Archive]
```

**Key Components:**
- Log Collector/Agent: Gathers events from endpoints, network, and cloud.
- Ingestion Pipeline: Normalizes and enriches data.
- Correlation & Rules Engine: Detects threats and policy violations.
- Analyst Dashboard: Investigates alerts and trends.
- Compliance Module: Generates reports for audits.
- Data Lake/Archive: Stores raw and processed logs for long-term analysis.
