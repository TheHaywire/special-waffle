# DevSecOps & Automation Architectures

---

## 1. CI/CD Security Checks & Pipeline Automation

**Description:**
Automate security checks in CI/CD pipelines, including SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, IaC scanning, and supply chain security, to shift security left and ensure secure software delivery.

**Architecture Diagram:**

    A[Developer] -->|Code Commit| B[Source Repo (Git)]
    B -->|Webhook| C[CI/CD Orchestrator (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)]
    C -->|Build/Test| D[Build Environment]
    D -->|SAST/DAST/Dependency Scan| E[Security Tools]
    E -->|Findings| F[Pipeline Gate]
    F -->|Pass/Fail| G[Deploy to Staging/Prod]
    E -->|Logs| H[SIEM/Log Management]
```

**Key Components:**
- Source Repo: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- CI/CD Orchestrator: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI.
- Build Environment: Containerized or VM-based build runners.
- Security Tools: SAST (SonarQube, Semgrep), DAST (OWASP ZAP), Dependency Scanners (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk), IaC Scanners (Checkov, tfsec).
- Pipeline Gate: Enforces pass/fail based on security findings.
- SIEM/Log Management: Stores scan results and pipeline logs.

## 2. Self-Healing Infrastructure

**Description:**
Detect and automatically remediate misconfigurations, drift, or attacks in cloud and on-prem infrastructure using policy-as-code and automation.

**Architecture Diagram:**

    A[Cloud/Infra Resources] -->|Monitor| B[Policy Engine (OPA/Cloud Custodian)]
    B -->|Detect Drift/Violation| C[Automation Orchestrator (Ansible/Lambda)]
    C -->|Remediation Action| A
    B -->|Alert| D[Security Team]
    C -->|Logs| E[SIEM/Log Management]
```

**Key Components:**
- Policy Engine: OPA (Open Policy Agent), Cloud Custodian, AWS Config.
- Automation Orchestrator: Ansible, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, custom scripts.
- SIEM/Log Management: Centralized event and remediation logging.
- Security Team: Receives alerts for manual review if needed.

## 3. Supply Chain Security & SBOM Automation

**Description:**
Automate generation, validation, and monitoring of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and third-party dependencies to detect supply chain risks.

**Architecture Diagram:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Source Code/Dependencies] -->|SBOM Generation| B[SBOM Tool (Syft/Trivy)]
    B -->|SBOM File| C[SBOM Repository]
    C -->|Validation| D[Policy Engine]
    D -->|Alerts| E[Security Team]
    D -->|Pass/Fail| F[CI/CD Pipeline]
    B -->|Vuln Scan| G[Vulnerability DB (OSV/NVD)]
    G -->|Findings| D
```

**Key Components:**
- SBOM Tool: Syft, Trivy, CycloneDX.
- SBOM Repository: Stores and versions SBOMs (e.g., Git, Artifactory).
- Policy Engine: Validates SBOMs against policies (e.g., license, known vulns).
- Vulnerability DB: OSV, NVD, Snyk, GitHub Advisory DB.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Integrates SBOM checks into build/release process.
- Security Team: Reviews alerts and findings.

## Project Ideas
- End-to-end secure CI/CD pipeline template (with all security checks pre-integrated)
- Automated IaC security audit and remediation bot
- SBOM dashboard and alerting system for new vulnerabilities
- Self-healing cloud infrastructure demo (auto-remediation of S3 bucket misconfig, etc.)
- Open-source supply chain security toolkit

---

## Responsible Use & Ethics
- Ensure automation does not disrupt production without human review (fail-safe gates)
- Respect privacy and compliance when scanning code and infra
- Document all automated actions and provide rollback options
