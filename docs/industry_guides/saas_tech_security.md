## Key Compliance Requirements
- **SOC 2:** Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy
- **ISO 27001:** Information security management system (ISMS), risk assessment, controls
- **GDPR:** Data privacy, consent management, breach reporting

## Example: CI/CD Security for SOC 2/ISO 27001
- Integrate [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/), and [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) into your CI/CD pipeline
- Automate SAST, DAST, dependency, and IaC scanning
- Enforce pipeline gates for critical findings

---

## Example: SBOM & Supply Chain Security
- Use [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) or [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) to generate SBOMs
- Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities and license compliance
- Use [CycloneDX Web](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-web) for dashboarding

---

## Incident Response Workflow (Cloud/API Breach)
1. **Detection:** SIEM or API security tool alert for suspicious activity or data exfiltration
2. **Triage:** Analyst reviews logs, correlates with cloud and API activity
3. **Containment:** Revoke API keys, isolate affected services, block malicious IPs
4. **Eradication:** Patch vulnerabilities, rotate credentials, update configs
5. **Recovery:** Restore services, monitor for recurrence
6. **Reporting:** Document incident, notify affected customers and regulators as required by SOC 2/ISO 27001/GDPR

---

## Sector-Specific Tips
- Enforce least privilege and strong IAM for cloud and SaaS platforms
- Regularly review and test incident response plans for cloud-native threats
- Monitor for supply chain risks in third-party dependencies and APIs
- Automate compliance evidence collection for audits
- Document all compliance activities and security controls
