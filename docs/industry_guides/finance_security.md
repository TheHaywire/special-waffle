## Key Compliance Requirements
- **PCI DSS:** Payment card data protection, log monitoring, access control, vulnerability management
- **SOX:** Financial data integrity, audit trails, change management
- **GLBA:** Customer data privacy, risk assessment, incident response

## Example: SIEM Deployment for PCI DSS
- Deploy [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/) or [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) using the [SIEM Setup Guide](open_source_siem.md)
- Configure log collection from:
  - Payment processing systems
  - Database servers
  - Firewalls and network devices
- Set up alerts for:
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Suspicious transactions
  - Changes to critical files or configurations

---

## Example: IAM for SOX/GLBA
- Deploy [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/)
- Integrate with SSO, MFA, and user provisioning
- Enforce least privilege and regular access reviews

---

## Incident Response Workflow (Financial Fraud)
1. **Detection:** SIEM alert for anomalous transaction or unauthorized access
2. **Triage:** Analyst reviews logs, correlates with user activity
3. **Containment:** Disable affected accounts, block suspicious IPs
4. **Eradication:** Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems, monitor for recurrence
6. **Reporting:** Document incident, notify regulators as required

---

## Sector-Specific Tips
- Regularly test incident response with simulated fraud scenarios
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Monitor for insider threats and privilege misuse
- Stay updated on evolving financial cyber threats (e.g., AI-driven fraud)
- Document all compliance activities for audits
