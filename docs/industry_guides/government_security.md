# Government Sector Security Setup Guide

---

## Overview
This guide provides actionable InfoSec recommendations for government organizations, mapping compliance requirements (FISMA, FedRAMP, CJIS, GDPR) to open-source tools and architectures. It includes example configurations, incident response workflows, and sector-specific best practices.

## Key Compliance Requirements
- **FISMA:** Federal information security management, risk assessment, continuous monitoring
- **FedRAMP:** Cloud service provider security, authorization, continuous monitoring
- **CJIS:** Criminal justice data protection, access control, audit logging
- **GDPR:** Data privacy, consent management, breach reporting

## Example: IAM for FISMA/FedRAMP
- Deploy [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/)
- Integrate with SSO, MFA, and user provisioning
- Enforce least privilege, RBAC, and regular access reviews

---

## Example: SIEM for CJIS/FISMA
- Deploy [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/) or [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)
- Collect logs from endpoints, network devices, and cloud services
- Set up alerts for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and policy violations

---

## Incident Response Workflow (Data Exfiltration)
1. **Detection:** SIEM alert for suspicious data transfer or unauthorized access
2. **Triage:** Analyst reviews logs, identifies affected systems and data
3. **Containment:** Disable compromised accounts, block malicious IPs, isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication:** Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, reset credentials
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems, monitor for recurrence
6. **Reporting:** Document incident, notify authorities and affected individuals as required by FISMA/FedRAMP/CJIS/GDPR

---

## Sector-Specific Tips
- Classify data and apply controls based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements
- Use end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Regularly test incident response with simulated data exfiltration scenarios
- Automate compliance evidence collection and reporting
- Document all compliance activities for audits
