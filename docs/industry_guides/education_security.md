## Key Compliance Requirements
- **FERPA:** Student data privacy, access control, breach notification
- **GDPR:** Data privacy, consent management, breach reporting

## Example: Security Awareness & Phishing Simulation
- Deploy [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) or [Quizzer](https://github.com/quizzer/quizzer) for security training
- Use [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/) to run simulated phishing campaigns
- Track user participation and improvement over time

---

## Example: Data Privacy Analytics for FERPA/GDPR
- Use [OpenDP](https://opendp.org/) or custom analytics to analyze student data with privacy guarantees
- Log and monitor access to sensitive student records
- Regularly review and update privacy policies

---

## Incident Response Workflow (Student Data Breach)
1. **Detection:** SIEM or alert for unauthorized access to student records
2. **Triage:** Analyst reviews logs, confirms scope of breach
3. **Containment:** Disable compromised accounts, isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication:** Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, reset credentials
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems, monitor for recurrence
6. **Reporting:** Notify affected students, parents, and regulators as required by FERPA/GDPR

---

## Sector-Specific Tips
- Train staff and students on phishing, social engineering, and privacy best practices
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for student information systems
- Regularly test incident response with simulated data breach scenarios
- Document all compliance activities for audits
- Monitor for ransomware and data leak threats targeting education
