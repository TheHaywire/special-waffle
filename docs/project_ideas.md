# InfoSec Project Ideas by Security Domain (2024)

---

## 1. Network Security
- **AI-Powered Honeypots:** Decoy systems that use AI/LLMs to adapt and deceive attackers, gathering threat intelligence.  
  - Example: [AI Sweden Project](https://www.ai.se/en/project/ai-powered-honeypots)
- **ML-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Detects network anomalies and attacks using ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- **Firewall Automation & Visualization:** Automate firewall rule management and visualize network flows.

---

## 2. Application Security
- **LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Agents:** Automate web app pentesting, payload generation, and reporting with LLMs.  
  - Example: [VibePenTester](https://github.com/firetix/vibe-pen-tester)
- **Dynamic Security Policy Enforcer:** Real-time, context-aware access control using PBAC/ABAC.
- **API Security Scanner:** Scan and test APIs for vulnerabilities (OWASP API Top 10).

---

## 3. Cloud Security
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):** Audit cloud resources for misconfigurations using open-source or serverless tools.  
  - Example: [Simple CSPM](https://simplecspm.com/)
- **Insecure Kubernetes Playground:** Deploy purposely insecure K8s clusters for tool testing and training.  
  - Example: [insecure-kubernetes-deployments](https://github.com/latiotech/insecure-kubernetes-deployments)
- **Cloud Threat Detection & Response:** Monitor and respond to threats in AWS/Azure/GCP (e.g., Poseidonâ€™s Trident).

---

## 4. Endpoint Security
- **Open Source EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response):** Agent-based monitoring for malware, ransomware, and suspicious activity.
- **Automated Malware Analysis Sandbox:** Analyze files in isolated environments using open-source sandboxes.

---

## 5. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- **Blockchain-Based Identity Management System:** Decentralized, self-sovereign identity using blockchain and verifiable credentials.
- **Zero-Knowledge Role Assignment:** Prove authorization without revealing identity (see Voxkryptia).

---

## 6. Security Operations (SOC/SIEM/IR)
- **AI-Powered SOC Dashboard:** Real-time threat monitoring, digital forensics, and incident response in one dashboard.  
  - Example: [CyberNexus](https://github.com/Aishwarya2701/CyberNexus)
- **Incident Response Simulation Tool:** Simulate and practice IR scenarios (network, endpoint, email attacks).
- **Open Source SIEM:** Log collection, correlation, and alerting (e.g., ELK stack, iSOC).

---

## 7. Threat Intelligence & Hunting
- **Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP):** Aggregate, analyze, and visualize threat feeds (MISP, custom TIPs).
- **Dark Web Paste Monitor:** Scrape paste sites for leaks and keywords.
- **OSINT Toolkit:** Modular plugins for domain, IP, and email intelligence.

---

## 8. Vulnerability Management
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanner:** Scan networks, apps, and cloud for vulnerabilities (OpenVAS, custom tools).
- **Vulnerability Management Dashboard:** Track, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities.

---

## 9. Data Security & Privacy
- **Differential Privacy Analytics:** Privacy-preserving data analysis for sensitive datasets.
- **Blockchain-Based Immutable Audit Logs:** Tamper-proof, distributed event tracking.

---

## 10. Offensive Security (Red Team, Pentesting)
- **LLM Pentesting Agents & KaliGPT:** AI assistants for red teams, payload generation, and exploit automation.  
  - Example: [KaliGPT](https://infosecwriteups.com/kaligpt-the-cybersecurity-sidekick-you-wish-you-had-during-that-3am-incident-2fbb2bc43c5f?gi=845c500607c7&source=rss----7b722bfd1b8d---4)
- **Phishing Simulation Platform:** Send and track simulated phishing campaigns.

---

## 11. Deception & Honeypots
- **AI-Powered Honeypots:** (See Network Security above; also covers IoT, ICS, and web environments.)
- **Multi-Honeypot Suites:** Deploy a range of honeypots for research and monitoring.

---

## 12. Security Awareness & Training
- **Security Awareness Training Portal:** Deliver and track training modules and quizzes.
- **Phishing Simulation Platform:** (See Offensive Security above.)

---

## 13. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- **Compliance Automation Tool:** Automate policy management, risk assessment, and reporting.
- **Blockchain Audit Logs:** (See Data Security above.)

---

## 14. DevSecOps & Automation
- **CI/CD Security Checks:** Automated code review, supply chain security, and IaC scanning.
- **Self-Healing Infrastructure:** Detect and remediate misconfigurations or attacks automatically.

---

## 15. Emerging Tech (AI/ML, Blockchain, IoT, Quantum)
- **Cyber DNA Profiler (CDNAP):** Profile software, networks, and attacks using ML and graph theory.  
  - Example: [CDNAP](https://github.com/Alien979/cdnap)
- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption Tool:** Implement and test post-quantum cryptography algorithms.
- **IoT Security Lab:** IoT honeypots, firmware analysis, and device fingerprinting.
