# Pro Workflows: Education Industry Security

## 1. Student Data Privacy & FERPA Compliance Automation
**Problem:** Manual FERPA compliance checks are slow and often miss student data exposures.

**Workflow:**

    A[Student Data Sources] --> B[DLP Scanner (OpenDLP/Varonis)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Compliance Dashboard]
    C -->|Alert| D[Privacy/Security Team]
    C -->|Report| E[Compliance Officers]
```
**Tools:** OpenDLP, Varonis, Wazuh, custom FERPA scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Schedule automated student data scans and compliance checks
- Use LLMs to interpret findings and suggest remediations

**Metrics:** 100% student data coverage, reduced FERPA violations

## 2. Secure Remote Learning Environments
**Problem:** Remote learning platforms are frequent targets for attacks and data breaches.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Remote Learning Platform] --> B[Security Scanner (OpenVAS/Nessus)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Vulnerability Dashboard]
    C -->|High Risk| D[Patch/Restrict]
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Monitor]
```
**Tools:** OpenVAS, Nessus, Wazuh, custom scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate vulnerability scanning and patch management for learning platforms
- Use LLMs to prioritize vulnerabilities and recommend fixes

**Metrics:** 95%+ platform coverage, reduced breaches

    A[Phishing Campaign] --> B[Inbox (Faculty/Student)]
    B -->|Click/Report| C[Awareness Platform (GoPhish)]
    C -->|Track| D[Metrics Dashboard]
    D -->|Feedback| E[User]
```
**Tools:** GoPhish, KnowBe4, Lucy Security

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate phishing simulations and feedback
- Use LLMs to generate realistic phishing templates and analyze results

**Metrics:** 90%+ participation, reduced phishing success rates
