    A[Remote Learning Platform] --> B[Security Scanner (OpenVAS/Nessus)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Vulnerability Dashboard]
    C -->|High Risk| D[Patch/Restrict]
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Monitor]
```
**Tools:** OpenVAS, Nessus, Wazuh, custom scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate vulnerability scanning and patch management for learning platforms
- Use LLMs to prioritize vulnerabilities and recommend fixes

**Metrics:** 95%+ platform coverage, reduced breaches

    B -->|Click/Report| C[Awareness Platform (GoPhish)]
    C -->|Track| D[Metrics Dashboard]
    D -->|Feedback| E[User]
```
**Tools:** GoPhish, KnowBe4, Lucy Security

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate phishing simulations and feedback
- Use LLMs to generate realistic phishing templates and analyze results

**Metrics:** 90%+ participation, reduced phishing success rates
