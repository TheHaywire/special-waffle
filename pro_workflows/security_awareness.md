# Pro Workflows: Security Awareness

## 1. Automated Phishing Simulation & Training
**Problem:** Employees remain vulnerable to phishing without regular, realistic training.

## 2. Just-in-Time Security Microlearning
**Problem:** Annual training is quickly forgotten and rarely changes behavior.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Security Event/Trigger] --> B[Awareness Platform]
    B -->|Deliver| C[Microlearning Module]
    C -->|Complete| D[Track Progress]
    D -->|Report| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** KnowBe4, Curricula, Lucy Security, custom LMS

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Trigger microlearning based on real events (e.g., phishing click)
- Use LLMs to personalize content and quizzes

**Metrics:** 80%+ completion rate, improved security behavior

**References:** KnowBe4, Curricula, Lucy Security

## 3. Security Champions Program Automation
**Problem:** Security culture is hard to scale without distributed ownership.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Champion Nomination] --> B[Awareness Platform]
    B -->|Onboard| C[Champions]
    C -->|Engage| D[Security Initiatives]
    D -->|Report| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** KnowBe4, custom scripts, Slack/Teams integrations

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate nomination, onboarding, and engagement tracking
- Use LLMs to analyze champion impact and suggest improvements

**Metrics:** 10%+ workforce as champions, increased security engagement
