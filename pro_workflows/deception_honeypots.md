# Pro Workflows: Deception & Honeypots

## 1. Automated Honeypot Deployment & Monitoring
**Problem:** Manual honeypot setup is slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale.

**Workflow:**

    A[Deployment Trigger] --> B[Honeypot Platform (T-Pot/OpenCanary)]
    B -->|Deploy| C[Honeypot Instances]
    C -->|Monitor| D[Central Dashboard]
    D -->|Alert| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** T-Pot, OpenCanary, Cowrie, Modern Honey Network

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate deployment and monitoring of honeypots
- Use LLMs to analyze honeypot logs and generate threat intel

**Metrics:** 100% coverage of key network segments, faster threat detection

## 2. Deception Credential Injection
**Problem:** Attackers often harvest real credentials; deception credentials can detect and mislead them.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Credential Generation] --> B[Deception Platform (OpenCanary/Cowrie)]
    B -->|Inject| C[Endpoints/Apps]
    C -->|Monitor| D[Alert on Use]
    D -->|Investigate| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** OpenCanary, Cowrie, custom scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate credential generation and injection
- Use LLMs to correlate alerts and suggest responses

**Metrics:** Increased detection of credential theft, reduced attacker dwell time

## 3. Threat Intelligence from Deception Systems
**Problem:** Honeypot data is underutilized for threat intelligence and proactive defense.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Honeypot Logs] --> B[Log Aggregator (ELK/Splunk)]
    B -->|Parse| C[Threat Intel Engine]
    C -->|Enrich| D[Threat Feeds]
    D -->|Report| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** ELK Stack, Splunk, MISP, OpenCanary

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate log parsing and threat enrichment
- Use LLMs to summarize findings and generate IOCs

**Metrics:** More actionable threat intel, faster response to new TTPs
