# Pro Workflows: Healthcare Industry Security

## 1. HIPAA Compliance Automation & Monitoring
**Problem:** Manual HIPAA compliance monitoring is slow, inconsistent, and often misses PHI exposure.

**Workflow:**

    A[PHI Data Sources] --> B[DLP Scanner (OpenDLP/Varonis)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Compliance Dashboard]
    C -->|Alert| D[Privacy/Security Team]
    C -->|Report| E[Compliance Officers]
```
**Tools:** OpenDLP, Varonis, Wazuh, custom HIPAA scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Schedule automated PHI scans and compliance checks
- Use LLMs to interpret findings and suggest remediations

**Metrics:** 100% PHI coverage, reduced HIPAA violations

## 2. Medical Device Security Monitoring
**Problem:** Medical devices are often unpatched and vulnerable, creating patient safety risks.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Medical Devices] --> B[Device Scanner (OpenVAS/Nessus)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Vulnerability Dashboard]
    C -->|High Risk| D[Patch/Isolate]
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Schedule Patch]
```
**Tools:** OpenVAS, Nessus, Wazuh, custom medical device scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate vulnerability scanning and patch management
- Use LLMs to prioritize patches based on patient safety impact

**Metrics:** 95%+ device coverage, reduced device vulnerabilities

## 3. Patient Data Access Monitoring & Audit
**Problem:** Unauthorized access to patient data is hard to detect and investigate.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Access Events] --> B[SIEM (ELK/Wazuh)]
    B -->|Analyze| C[Access Patterns]
    C -->|Anomaly| D[Alert Security Team]
    C -->|Normal| E[Log for Audit]
```
**Tools:** ELK Stack, Wazuh, custom audit scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Use ML to detect anomalous access patterns
- Automate audit report generation for compliance

**Metrics:** 100% access logging, faster incident detection
