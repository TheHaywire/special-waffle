# Pro Workflows: Government Industry Security

## 1. FedRAMP Compliance Automation
**Problem:** Manual FedRAMP compliance monitoring is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.

**Workflow:**

    A[FedRAMP Controls] --> B[Compliance Scanner (OpenSCAP/Qualys)]
    B -->|Scan| C[FedRAMP Dashboard]
    C -->|Alert| D[Security/Compliance Team]
    C -->|Report| E[Authorizing Officials]
```
**Tools:** OpenSCAP, Qualys, Wazuh, custom FedRAMP scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Schedule automated FedRAMP scans and reporting
- Use LLMs to interpret findings and suggest remediations

**Metrics:** 100% control coverage, reduced audit findings

**References:** FedRAMP guidelines, OpenSCAP, NIST SP 800-53

## 2. Classified Data Protection & Monitoring
**Problem:** Unauthorized access to classified data is a critical national security risk.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Classified Systems] --> B[Access Monitor (Wazuh/ELK)]
    B -->|Analyze| C[Access Patterns]
    C -->|Unauthorized| D[Alert/Block]
    C -->|Authorized| E[Log for Audit]
```
**Tools:** Wazuh, ELK Stack, custom classified data scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Use ML to detect anomalous access patterns
- Automate incident response for unauthorized access

**Metrics:** 100% access monitoring, faster incident response

**References:** Wazuh, ELK Stack, NIST SP 800-53

## 3. Supply Chain Security Monitoring
**Problem:** Government supply chains are vulnerable to compromise and require continuous monitoring.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Supply Chain] --> B[Security Scanner (OpenVAS/SonarQube)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Risk Dashboard]
    C -->|High Risk| D[Investigate/Block]
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Monitor]
```
**Tools:** OpenVAS, SonarQube, Wazuh, custom supply chain scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate supply chain security assessments
- Use LLMs to analyze risk patterns and suggest mitigations

**Metrics:** 95%+ supply chain coverage, reduced supply chain risks
