# Pro Workflows: Application Security

## 1. Automated Web Application Scanning
**Problem:** Manual web app testing is slow, inconsistent, and often skipped.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[App Deployment/Update] --> B[DAST Scanner (OWASP ZAP/Arachni)]
    B -->|Findings| C[CI/CD Pipeline]
    C -->|Block/Pass| D[Developer Feedback]
    C -->|Pass| E[Deploy to Prod]
```
**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Arachni, Nikto, GitHub Actions, Jenkins

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Integrate DAST into CI/CD for every build
- Use LLMs to summarize findings and suggest fixes

**Metrics:** 90%+ coverage of web apps, faster feedback, fewer vulns in prod

## 2. API Security Automation
**Problem:** APIs are a top attack vector, but often lack automated security testing.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Spec/Endpoints] --> B[API Scanner (OWASP ZAP/42Crunch)]
    B -->|Scan| C[API Security Findings]
    C -->|Block/Pass| D[CI/CD Pipeline]
    C -->|Report| E[Developer Feedback]
```
**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, 42Crunch, APISec, Postman, GitHub Actions

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Auto-scan APIs on every update or deployment
- Use LLMs to triage and prioritize findings

**Metrics:** 80%+ reduction in API vulns, faster remediation

## 3. Secure Code Review with LLMs
**Problem:** Manual code review is slow, inconsistent, and misses subtle issues.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Pull Request] --> B[LLM Code Review (OpenAI/Llama)]
    B -->|Findings| C[Developer Feedback]
    B -->|Approve| D[Merge]
```
**Tools:** OpenAI, Llama, GitHub Copilot, SonarQube, Semgrep

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Use LLMs to review code for security issues and suggest remediations
- Integrate with PR workflows for instant feedback

**Metrics:** 70%+ reduction in code review time, higher vuln detection
