# Pro Workflows: Finance Industry Security

## 1. Automated PCI DSS Compliance Monitoring
**Problem:** Manual PCI DSS compliance checks are slow, error-prone, and often miss ongoing violations.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[PCI Controls] --> B[Compliance Scanner (OpenSCAP/Qualys)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Compliance Dashboard]
    C -->|Alert| D[Security/Compliance Team]
    C -->|Report| E[Auditors]
```
**Tools:** OpenSCAP, Qualys, Wazuh, custom PCI scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Schedule automated PCI scans and reporting
- Use LLMs to interpret scan results and suggest remediations

**Metrics:** 100% PCI control coverage, reduced audit findings

**References:** PCI DSS guidelines, OpenSCAP, Qualys

## 2. Real-time Fraud Detection & Response
**Problem:** Financial fraud detection is often reactive and slow, leading to significant losses.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Transaction Data] --> B[Fraud Detection Engine (Apache Spark/ML)]
    B -->|Analyze| C[Risk Scoring]
    C -->|High Risk| D[Block/Alert]
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Allow]
```
**Tools:** Apache Spark, TensorFlow, Wazuh, custom ML models

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Use ML models to detect fraud patterns in real-time
- Automate fraud response actions (block, alert, investigate)

**Metrics:** 90%+ fraud detection rate, reduced false positives

**References:** Apache Spark, TensorFlow, financial fraud patterns

## 3. Regulatory Reporting Automation (SOX, GLBA)
**Problem:** Manual regulatory reporting is time-consuming and prone to errors.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Security Events] --> B[Log Aggregator (ELK/Splunk)]
    B -->|Parse| C[Compliance Engine]
    C -->|Generate| D[Regulatory Reports]
    D -->|Submit| E[Regulators]
```
**Tools:** ELK Stack, Splunk, custom reporting scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate report generation and submission
- Use LLMs to summarize findings and flag compliance issues

**Metrics:** 100% report accuracy, reduced manual effort

**References:** SOX guidelines, GLBA requirements, ELK Stack
