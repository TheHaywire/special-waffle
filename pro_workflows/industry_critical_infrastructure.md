# Pro Workflows: Critical Infrastructure Security

## 1. ICS/SCADA Network Segmentation & Monitoring
**Problem:** Flat networks in critical infrastructure increase the risk of widespread compromise.

**Workflow:**

    A[ICS/SCADA Devices] --> B[Network Segmentation (Firewalls/VLANs)]
    B -->|Enforce| C[Monitored Zones]
    C -->|Monitor| D[IDS/IPS (Snort/Suricata)]
    D -->|Alert| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** Snort, Suricata, pfSense, custom segmentation scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate network segmentation policy enforcement
- Use LLMs to analyze IDS/IPS alerts for critical threats

**Metrics:** 100% network segmentation, reduced lateral movement

**References:** Snort, Suricata, ICS security best practices

## 2. OT Asset Inventory & Vulnerability Management
**Problem:** Untracked OT assets and unpatched vulnerabilities are a major risk in critical infrastructure.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[OT Devices] --> B[Asset Discovery (Nmap/Custom)]
    B -->|Inventory| C[Vulnerability Scanner (OpenVAS)]
    C -->|Findings| D[Remediation Plan]
    D -->|Patch/Isolate| E[OT Devices]
```
**Tools:** Nmap, OpenVAS, custom asset scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate asset discovery and vulnerability scanning
- Use LLMs to prioritize remediation based on risk

**Metrics:** 95%+ asset coverage, reduced unpatched vulnerabilities

**References:** Nmap, OpenVAS, ICS-CERT

## 3. Incident Response Automation for Critical Infrastructure
**Problem:** Manual incident response is too slow for high-impact critical infrastructure attacks.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Security Alert] --> B[SOAR Platform (Shuffle/TheHive)]
    B -->|Playbook| C[Automated Response]
    C -->|Contain/Remediate| D[OT/IT Systems]
    C -->|Report| E[Security Team]
```
**Tools:** Shuffle, TheHive, custom SOAR scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate incident response playbooks for common attack scenarios
- Use LLMs to generate incident summaries and lessons learned

**Metrics:** 90%+ incident containment rate, reduced response time

**References:** Shuffle, TheHive, ICS-CERT
