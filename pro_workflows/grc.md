# Pro Workflows: Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

## 1. Automated Risk Assessment & Register
**Problem:** Manual risk assessments are slow, subjective, and often outdated.

**Workflow:**

    B -->|Analyze| C[Risk Register]
    C -->|Report| D[GRC/Leadership]
```
**Tools:** OpenRMF, Eramba, Risk Register, GRC Toolbox

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate risk scoring and register updates
- Use LLMs to summarize risks and suggest mitigations

**Metrics:** 90%+ asset coverage, faster risk reviews

## 2. Policy Management & Attestation Automation
**Problem:** Policy distribution and attestation are often manual, leading to gaps and non-compliance.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Policy Draft] --> B[GRC Platform (Eramba/DocRead)]
    B -->|Distribute| C[Employees]
    C -->|Attest| D[Attestation Records]
    D -->|Report| E[GRC/Compliance Team]
```
**Tools:** Eramba, DocRead, GRC Toolbox, custom scripts

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Automate policy distribution and attestation tracking
- Use LLMs to analyze attestation gaps and recommend actions

**Metrics:** 100% policy attestation, reduced compliance gaps

**References:** Eramba docs, DocRead, ISO 27001

## 3. Continuous Compliance Monitoring
**Problem:** Compliance checks are often point-in-time, missing ongoing violations.

**Workflow:**
```mermaid

    A[Compliance Controls] --> B[Monitoring Tool (OpenSCAP/Auditd)]
    B -->|Scan| C[Compliance Dashboard]
    C -->|Alert| D[GRC/Compliance Team]
```
**Tools:** OpenSCAP, Auditd, Eramba, GRC Toolbox

**Automation/AI Tips:**
- Schedule automated compliance scans and reporting
- Use LLMs to interpret scan results and flag issues

**Metrics:** 95%+ control coverage, reduced audit findings
